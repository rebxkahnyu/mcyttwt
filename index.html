          <b><i id="intro">INTRODUCTION</b></i><br>
          The modern <span class="big">Minecraft Youtuber (MCYT)</span> community has taken Twitch, Youtube, and Twitter by storm. I love Minecraft a lot, and have watched all the popular Youtubers back when I was 12 (I’m 19 now). <br><br>

          I returned to become a huge fan of more Minecraft Youtubers in 2020, specifically <span class="green">Dream</span> and others around him: GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap, TommyInnit, Tubbo, Ranboo, Technoblade, etc.<br><br>

          I ended up making a twitter account just to follow these white men, engage with them, talk about them, and make friends with those who also enjoyed their content (which to this day I still think was really entertaining actually).<br><br>

          I do this often with content or celebrities I like because I get fixated on them and Twitter is a place where I can ramble about my interests without annoying anyone in real life. So I joined Minecraft Youtuber twitter <span class="green">(mcyttwt)</span>.<br><br>

          I mostly regret it. Here’s why.<br><br>

          <span class="green"><b>Disclaimer:</b></span> This site is not to hate on anyone. The images on the map are for humor and entertainment purposes. <br><br>






          <b><i id="stanTwt">STAN TWITTER</b></i><br>
          Stan twitter is a strange place. It welcomes you so easily yet gatekeeps anything when it gets the chance, you can say whatever you want yet god forbid you have an opinion, it’s all fun and games until someone sends you your own address, one side excuses someone’s terrible actions and the other side bullies them relentlessly, it’s full of loving artists yet also people who draw minors in NSFW art, and the pros and cons go on.<br><br>

          After getting out of mcyttwt in early 2022, I realized how much damage it did to my mental and social health. <u>At the time it was super fun,</u> I learned a lot, and still liked some of the experience even now. But I genuinely feel like it was <span class="green">as if I was in a cult</span>, where I wasn’t obligated to devote myself to any of these people yet I did, <br><br>

          and <span class="green"><u>very willingly.</u></span> <br><br>

          And when I say “devote myself” <u>I mean it,</u> like, for almost two years of my life <u>all I did</u> was watch their streams and catch up on what was happening with everyone online – with all these people I don’t know in real life. It was <span class="blue">everything to me.</span><br><br>

          Being in an online community for a real life person is a new concept. I can describe it like this:<br><br>

          - <span class="green">FOMO is very real</span>, and it haunts you so you’re stuck scrolling through twitter all day<br><br>

          - You identify yourself with this community and this celebrity, so you want to be updated on everything and <span class="green">be a part of everything</span><br><br>

          - You’re able to voice your opinions while still being <span class="green">anonymous</span> (you can profess your love for that Youtuber without anyone knowing it’s you!)<br><br>

          - You have an easy way to <span class="green">make friends,</span> and an easy way to get into arguments<br><br>

          - You get to <span class="green">engage with celebrities</span> if they’re unpopular enough to give you their time, and you <span class="green">watch them get bullied</span> for the mistakes they make and the content they put out<br><br>

          - <span class="green">Fanart</span> is so cool and is the only good thing about fandoms (if they don’t involve the really… weird stuff)<br><br><br><br>








          <b><i id="parasocial">PARASOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS</b></i><br>
          A parasocial relationship is “a relationship that a person imagines having with another person whom they do not actually know, such as a celebrity or a fictional character” (Dictionary.com).<br><br>

          The thing is, I thought these were fine because I kind of had them with BTS. I felt some kind of connection with BTS, but they as well as other K-Pop groups are in a different league. They’re removed from normal working class society and also speak a different language. It’s the same concept for Hollywood celebrities and famous artists. Minecraft Youtubers and streamers are just <span class="green">normal people</span> who got lucky. <br><br>

          I didn’t realize how much more engaged I was with people not as famous (when they all weren’t as famous as they are now). <br><br>

          For some of us who had parasocial relationships with MCYTs, we would watch them every day, our entire world revolving around them. You feel like you are friends with these people, so you feel a <span class="blue">responsibility to like them no matter what happens.</span> You can imagine that this doesn’t end well.<br><br>

          Content creators mess up often, they say something racist, are accused of grooming, make insensitive “jokes”; it's "cancel culture" things that they are clearly not used to addressing – <u>especially if their fame grew exponentially quick</u> (cough Dream cough). And every time, stans forgive and defend them after they apologize. <br><br>

          We are so attached to them, and <u>we don’t want them to be bad people.</u><br><br>

          (I’m all about giving second chances but how many chances did Dream get from me???)<br><br>

          We have no duty or responsibility to be defending these people, but we do it anyway. Stans even put some content creators on pedestals for being so <span class="green">“unproblematic”</span> since they have never been cancelled or accused of anything. It all just feels really… unhuman. <br><br>

          <span class="blue">I liked these people so much I didn’t think they would do anything bad ever, that’s pretty much the whole issue.</span> They could be (and probably are) faking a persona, trying to be nice and loving towards their fans to make them more famous. Honestly, I can’t tell.<br><br>

          Whose fault is this? Is it ours for being ignorant or theirs for being manipulative?<br><br>

          Are they even being manipulative? <br><br>

          What if, <br><br>

          what IF<br><br>

          they really aren’t manipulative? What if these people <span class="green">are actually good?</span><br><br>

          <u>We’ll never know!</u> And I shouldn’t even be thinking about that in the first place!<br><br>

          Longing for them to be good or bad people is what’s taking up our time, when they are just rich people who don’t know we exist.<br><br>

          <span class="big">It</span><br><br>

          <span class="big">Doesn’t</span><br><br>

          <span class="big">Matter.</span><br><br>

          Except it does for some people (like it did for me), and I don’t understand the reason either.<br><br><br><br>








          <b><i id="myExp">MY EXPERIENCE</b></i><br>
          The reason could be that some people have fixations and can’t easily just leave a fandom. I’ve put so much time and so much of myself into these people it was difficult to just shut it all off and never come back. It was a lot harder to leave than I realize now. I was <span class="big">so</span> invested.<br><br>

          It was also <u>really fun</u> - the fanart is amazing, people are funny, and we get to talk about the things we collectively enjoy.<br><br>

          But people fight and argue with others (including the MCYTs themselves) and I saw <span class="blue">genuine cyberbullying very often.</span> Watching all of it and being a part of a community that has a bad reputation did take a toll on my health. <br><br>

          For example, when Technoblade stopped releasing content and eventually revealed his cancer diagnosis, I saw a LOT of people tweeting about how he still didn't apologize for his words from a past stream, saying he deserved it, or making fun of his looks. He passed away in June 2022. It terrified me and I cried a lot because of how gross it all felt.<br><br>

          Honestly, I <u>wanted</u> to be updated on drama, and <u>wanted</u> to be involved in some way when anything big happened in the twitter community, positive or negative.<br><br>

          <span class="green">Some of it is good,</span> I grew a huge respect for artists, I felt myself becoming more creative, and I became more educated on a lot of important topics.<br><br>

          It just doesn't seem like a waste of time when you’re invested.<br><br>

          I don’t even know what to say to those who are in internet fandoms that may be harmful except that I understand; I had a lot of fun but eventually it got tiring and embarrassing. How many times was I going to watch these guys get cancelled?<br><br><br><br>








          <b><i id="middleGround">MIDDLE GROUND?</b></i><br>
          How do you “balance” an online community? <br><br>

          Fandoms for social media celebrities are very new.<br><br>

          Can we enjoy extra content from content creators we like without being sucked into a cult-like community?<br><br>

          I like getting invested in my fixations and I really obsess over them but I don’t want to get into something that’s so hard to get out of. <br><br>

          Ludwig had put out a video called <a id="link" href="https://youtu.be/WzyQbfh4t_8">“I Am Not Your Friend”</a> that’s kind of a joke, but it’s an attempt if you want to check it out.<br><br>

          Overall, I was led to believe that it was bad if you “left” a MCYT if they did something problematic, but it’s <u>actually! Not!</u><br><br>

          At the end of the day, I should have stopped at the Minecraft Manhunt’s on Youtube instead of also joining social media. Many people like/liked Dream's videos and have no idea about all of this - and that's the best.<br><br>

          None of it was real and I wasted a lot of time.<br><br>

          I'd even say I was/am "chronically online", which is a whole different topic that's interesting. If you want to know more, Shanspeare has a video titled <a id="link" href="https://youtu.be/i0ldLIDnj84">"We're Chained to Our Phones and It's Scarier Than We Think."</a><br><br>

          If I can't control what content creators are doing, I think I should learn how to find that middle ground for myself.
